A blue, of course, was the first alternate cheese Willi produced with the buffalo milk. As with all buffalo milk he uses thermization for food safety reasons. "Buffalos like to play in the mud like pigs", explains Willi in order to explain why eventual bacteria need to be killed. He doesn't use any rennet, the milk is just naturally soured. Then the same two blue molds are added as Schmid applies to the Jersey Blue. After 12 weeks of aging the blue and green veins have reached the center, and the result is a well balanced blue that is on the milder side.
