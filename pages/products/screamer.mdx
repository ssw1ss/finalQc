Although in Switzerland the term "Triple Cream" does not exist since every cheese over 60% FIT is called "Double Cream" the Screamer is a classic triple cream with a minimum of 75% fat in the dry matter. It is an unbelievable experience in indulgence and luxury, a creaminess that seems to last forever.

No wonder Ueli Moser's creation won "Best Innovation" at the 2014 Swiss Cheese Awards. Just one award of many in his portfolio.
