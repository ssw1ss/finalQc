The Wooden Goat (Hölzige Geiss or Hölzerne Geiss) is a smaller version of the famous Bergfichte, and made of unpasteurized goat milk. Willi Schmid himself cuts the spruce bark that he uses around this little disk. The wood adds tannin to the already powerfull flavors. As with all strong cheeses they are not for everybody's taste, but the real cheese aficionado will indulge when he cuts into the top rind to reveal the creamy, runny inside. Of course, it is best to eat it with the washed rind, it adds a crunch to the texture.
