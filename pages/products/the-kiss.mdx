Quite frankly this is our favorite soft ripened cheese in the world. Caroline and Daniel discovered this gem during a skiing trip in Adelboden in the midst of the towering Bernese Alps in 2006. We found it in the beautiful shop of cheese maker Manfred Schmid who actually has this soft cheese made by three farmers. With an astonishing consistency in quality the "Berner Muentschi" (The Bernese Kiss) has never disappointed and been appreciated by many customers and top chefs. This is not just about the rich mouthfeel of double cream, it is packed with flavors none of them overwhelming though. There is a reason it is referring to a kiss, some say it is even better than that.
