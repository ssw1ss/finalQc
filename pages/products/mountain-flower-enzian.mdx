The mountain dairy Oberberg in Schuepfheim is operated by master cheese maker Franz Renggli and his wife Sandra with the children Sina and Linda. It is located in the only Swiss Bio-Sphere (organic production) aknowledged by UNESCO and situated across the moorland "Finsterwald" on a high plateau at an altitude of 3000 ft.
Franz Renggli only uses milk from the mountain zone and works with 16 farms in the vicinity. The cow breeds are Brown and Simmental.
For the Mountain Flower Enzian he uses thermized milk and animal rennet. The cheese is aged for at least 3 months and develops slightly spicy, but well balanced flavors. Of course, with the imprint of the famous mountain flower Enzian the cheese is visually attractive as well.
