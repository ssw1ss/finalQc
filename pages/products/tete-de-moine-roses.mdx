Our partner InterCheese has increased its production of convenience food, a way to separate them from a giant like Emmi. With state-of-the-art equipment they have become a leader in the trade. The tray of the famous Tête-de-Moine Roses (or better, rosettes) is just a quick way to present to guests an aperitive, or to enhance a cheese plate without any effort. What is usually created by putting a wheel of Tête-de-Moine on a girolle and shaving the rosettes is already done for you.
