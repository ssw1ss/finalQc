You taste a Sbrinz and you go on a journey back to early production of cheese where this was the only way to preserve dairy when refrigeration was not available. The first written documents about Sbrinz go back centuries, and legend has it that the Parmigiano is a copy of the Sbrinz: The Italians got weary to transport these 80 lbs wheels over the Alps and started to make their own hard cheese. The main - and significant - difference is that Parmigiano is made from skimmed milk and way saltier. And: The cows graze on the Alp meadows whereas the red cows who provide the milk for the Parmigiano have to stay inside!

The "Golden Nuggets" as you call the pieces of Sbrinz you break off are an ideal companion for almost everything. The Beeler Sbrinz was one of only two cheeses that got 99 pts. in Max McCalman's "Guide to the World's Best", and in a blind tasting it beat all the Parmigianos at the Slow Food Show in Bra/Italy. It was also elected as "the cheese that goes with every imaginable drink”.

The winners of the Adopt-an-Alp contest visited the operation of Res Gut on Alp Chüeneren in mid June 2019. They were impressed with the facility and even more so with the craftsmanship of the cheesemaker. Res stays on the Alp throughout the year, however the animals are up there only in the summer.
