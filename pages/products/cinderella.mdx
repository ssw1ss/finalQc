Who doesn’t like the story of “Cinderella”, or “Aschenputtel” as it is called in German. And the Cinderella cheese is an outstanding product in every aspect, a product, you only find when you work closely with affineurs like Rolf Beeler, or, as in this case, with Christoph Bruni whom we finally brought on board after years of coaxing.

Made by Jakob Beer, and award winning cheese maker of Emmentaler in the dairy of Oberwil by Büren, just minutes from where Caroline grew up. And the Cinderella relates very close to the story: As much as rugs and relentless hard work cannot cover up the girls beauty, the grayish-blackish rind isn’t dull at all and attracts the eye in every cheese display. And once you get the chance to be introduced to it the - love - story grows. First the funky inside with a paste that shows little holes randomly scattered and black-blueish spots that make you ask“Is it a blue?” when in fact those spots are salt crystals: Sea salt from the island of Cyprus blackened with Carbonis Medicinalis.

But the biggest revelation comes once you put a piece into your mouth. How can such a brittle piece be so smooth, melting on your palate, releasing milky flavors and a powerful salty kick in the finish. You don’t need to find the second glas shoe to realize that this is a queen.
