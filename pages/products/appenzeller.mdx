Appenzeller is one of the famous names in the Swiss cheese industry, just like Emmentaler or Gruyère. The Appenzell region in Eastern Switzerland with its rolling hills and green pastures is ideal for diary farming. So no wonder these cheeses have made themselves a name in the world.

What makes the Appenzeller so special is the brine. Of course, every cheese maker keeps the recipe of his brine secret. But it is generally made with a mix of herbs, liquor and/or wine.  The brine is also responsible for that dark line just below the rind that can have different colors, often purplish.
