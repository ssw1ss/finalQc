Made by the UNESCO Biosphere Mountain Dairy in the village of Doppleschwand the "Diva" is sure to attract everybody's attention with its gold platted rind. Diva is our first cheese of the certified moutain meadow milk line.

The UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch lies in the heart of Switzerland, protected by the massive central Alps. The valley is the eastern extension of the Emmental. Panning gold has had a long history in the area, particularly around the Napf peak. Still today you might find a nugget in the surrounding rivers and mountain creeks. Although gold panning in central Switzerland was mentioned the first time in the 12th century it reached its peak between the 16th and 19th century.
