            For over 2 decades, Quality Cheese has been the frontrunner when it
            comes to providing the American cheese market with some of the best
            Swiss cheeses. From the classics to specialty cheeses you've never
            heard of before, the products we exclusively resource and bring to
            the U.S reflect what our name promises.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Over all these years Quality Cheese has established a network on
            both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. We work with cheesemakers that
            think outside the box, and knowing them personally has allowed us to
            resource outstanding, innovative products. On the other side working
            with the U.S. cheese market has connected us with a variety of
            customers: from top chefs, specialty cheese and gourmet shops to
            store chains that put an emphasis on quality.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Out of the vastness of great Swiss cheeses we have picked those
            which are most beneficial to your health and are produced with
            respect towards the animals, the workers, and the environment.
