Another specialty from Franz Renggli of the Oberberg Dairy that lies in the UNESCO Biosphere in the valley of Entlebuch. The cheese is very smooth with a creamy mouthfeel, the chopped pumpkinseeds give it a good bite as a nice contrast. Jack-o'-Pumpkinseed will add a surprise to your cheese plate, it pairs well with any wines of good acidity.

Due to the relatively high water content the cheese also melts well (like a raclette).
The milk comes from cows that graze in the mountain zones around the dairy (no silage). The roasted pumpkinseeds origin in the Steiermark province of Austria, also famous for its excellent pumpkinseed oils.
