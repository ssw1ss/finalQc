This is our partner InterCheese’s version of an instand fondue mix, that is easy to prepare since all the necessary ingredients are in the sealed bag: Shredded Vacherin Fribourgeois (for creaminess), Gruyère and a certified mountain cheese (for flavor and spice), as well as the required liquids white wine and Kirsch and cornstarch.

Put the content of the bag into a saucepan or a real “caquelon” over medium heat and stirr constantly until the cheese has melted. Add pepper, garlic, shallots, nutmeg or other spices to your liking - a perfect meal is ready.

The mix has an excellent shelf life. Or you can freeze the bag and keep it for several months.
