When cheese maker Martin Egli joined Daniel und Thomas Studer in the dairy Hatswil in 2003 the "Scharfe Maxx" (Randy Maxx) was created as a celebration. Made of fresh thermized whole milk the semihard cheese has a wonderful paste, creamy yet with the hint of spice that really kicks in in the finish. It is washed with a special brine (secret recipe, of course) and aged a minimum of 5 to 7 months in a climate and humidity controlled cellar. The Scharfe Maxx undergoes a strict quality control, that is why the maturing period can be shorter or longer.

It was exclusively introduced to the US market by Quality Cheese in 2006.
