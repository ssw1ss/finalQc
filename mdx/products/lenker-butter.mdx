If you have never tasted a "Kaeserei Butter" (dairy butter) then - honestly - you don't know butter at all. An artisan dairy butter is nothing you can compare to a commercial butter. As the name says it is made in a dairy. Our Lenker Butter comes from the dairy in the Lenk in the midst of the Bernese Alps. The milk is from cows that spend the winter in the valley which, of course, is still a certified mountain zone. In the summer during transhumance they graze on the alp meadows in high altitude. The result: The quality of the milk is higher and the butter changes in color and taste according to the season.

The Lenker Butter has more fat content than commercially produced butter. 2/3 of the cream come from the milk, 1/3 from the remaining fat in the whey which is extracted with a centrifuge.
