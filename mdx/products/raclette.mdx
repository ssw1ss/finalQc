Raclette is a typical Swiss (and French) dish that has a long tradition. It’s melted cheese over steamed potatoes, pearl onions (or other pickles) and originates in the canton Valais in southwestern Switzerland. However it has long become a national dish therefore many different types of raclette and recipes, depending on the region, are available.
In newer times a lot of flavored raclettes have appeared (See below). Originally the wheels were round, but more and more you see the square raclettes which makes it easier to cut for the table grills at home.

Flavored Raclettes:

- White Wine, past. (14 lbs) square
- Roasted Onions, past. (14 lbs) square
- Garlic, past. (14 lbs) square
- Green Pepper, past. (14 lbs) square
- Paprika, past. (14 lbs) square
