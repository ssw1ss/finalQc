Mrs. Zuehlke, a cheese lover, is behind the creation of the Red Witch. In February when people celebrate the carnival, dress up (like on Halloween) she thought that a cheese that goes well with wine or beer or spirits would be nice for the long evenings. So she contacted acclaimed cheesemaker Christian Oberli, and they met in the restaurant of the main train station of the capital Berne to discuss proceedings.

He created the recipe, and with the cayenne peppery red rind as well as the "scary" label with the witch on her broom a visually attractive cheese was born. Made from raw whole milk the paste is creamy, easy melting, and relatively mild. But for Quality Cheese he increased the aging in his cellars from 5 to 7, 8 months when the Red Witch gets aromatic and nutty.
