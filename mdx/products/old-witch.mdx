The Old Witch is nothing else than the - OLDER - sister of the Red Witch. In fact, it is aged for a minimum of 9 months and it doesn’t have the red rind that her younger sister gets added just before she leaves the cellar.
The Old Witch is tastier, no wonder: The extra 3 to 4 months of aging in the Rislen dairy makes it spicier, but as a surprise she’s not getting drier. On the contrary you still get that creaminess and elasticity of the paste. All in all incredible well balanced - a true star for every cheese plate.
