Alphons Vogel is the 3rd generation cheese maker of the dairy in Steinerberg that was founded by is grandfather Johann in 1926. Located in the heart of the Alps and Switzerland the dairy has made a name for its pure and traditional products. This cheese gets an interesting twist from the 5% of goat milk that is added. The milk comes exclusively from organic farming in the two communities of Steinerberg (SZ) and Oberaegeri (ZG), therefore the name "Wildspitz" which is a mountain at the border of the Cantons Zug (ZG) and Schwyz (SZ). This mountain cheese has the typical flavors of the flora of the alpine foothills. It won a gold medal at the Mountain Cheese Olympics in 2007.
