Ueli Moser who - during his education as a master cheese maker - has also worked in France has made a name for himself for innovative cheese making. The Chardonnay Truffle definitively supports this claim. Made like the normal Moser Chardonnay, a decadent creamy Mascarpone core is added, enriched with shaves of black truffles. The thing with truffles is that in many products the aroma is overwhelming, especially when extracts are used. This is not the case here, the truffles are a supporting cast only, although an important one.

A hint: Just make a simple omelette, when it's almost done spread a few bits of Chardonnay Truffle and fold. Wait a moment to let the cheese melt and then eat - well if that doesn't lift your spirits we don't know what will.
