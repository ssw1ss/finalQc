The Hoch Ybrig (Hokh-Eebrig), together with Rolf's Gruyere, was the main reason that Beeler cheeses got a name in the U.S. When we started Quality Cheese at the beginning of 1998 this was one of the first handful cheeses we presented. It has been a flagship ever since. It is made by the Dorfkäserei (Village dairy) in Küssnacht am Rigi which was established in the middle of the 19th century. The Hoch Ybrig is made in the style of a Gruyere. Due to the smaller wheel it ages way quicker. Cheese maker Josef Werder uses only milk form cows that are fed with grass and hay only (no silage). The milk comes from several farms in the region of Mount Rigi and Lake Lucerne (Vierwaldstätter-See). Appel wine (cider with an alcohol content of about 6%) is added to the brine. It gives the Hoch Ybrig a hint of sweetness.
