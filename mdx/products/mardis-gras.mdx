We are really proud to have been able to source this product. Mardi Gras(s) is an outstanding cheese made in the style and the size of a Gruyère that reveals its full power after an aging process of a minimum of 18 months. Made by Samuel Trachsel who operates four dairies in northeastern Switzerland where he also produces Gruyère AOP and Sbrinz AOP. Caroline was taken away when she first tasted the cheese, it was simply a "must have”.

The name and label have three meanings: The mask hides indeed a classic Swiss cheese (Gruyère), it is made of whole milk, therefore the French word "gras" for fat. The animals are only fed with hay and grass!
