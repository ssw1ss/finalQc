The Tête-de-Moine AOP (Monk's Head) is not only one of the most special but also most historical cheeses. The name is first mentioned around 1790, the history though goes way back to the 12th century. In 1136 the monastery of Bellelay in the Swiss Jura Mountains was established, and the cheese making there is documented as early as 1192, almost exactly a 100 years before the foundation of Switzerland. There are two versions for the name: The first one refers to the monks' tonsure, the 2nd one to the fact that the cheeses were counted per "monk's head".

The picturesque dairy in Villeret is one of eight producers of the "Tête-de-Moine AOP". Located in Villeret in the valley of Combe-Crède the dairy gets the raw milk from six farmers twice a day. The cattle has to be fed naturally only (no silage), the milk is untreated.
