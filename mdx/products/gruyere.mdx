This is the real thing, the proof that Gruyère is not just Gruyère. One of the most famous cheeses in Switzerland and one of the proudest exports Rolf Beeler's Gruyere is made in the show dairy of Les Ponts-de-Martel in the heart of the Gruyère region. It is then aged in a cave for a minimum of 16 months - and exactly here lies the difference.

After about a year a Gruyère goes through a second fermentation, and if the cheese was not impeccably made it will develop cracks and get bad. That is why a majority of the gruyère production is sold before that. If you have not tasted the Beeler Gruyère you simply don't know Gruyère. It was the Top of the Show in the "Caseus Montaneus Awards" amongst over a 1000 cheeses. No matter what others say: The Beeler Gruyère is the best.
