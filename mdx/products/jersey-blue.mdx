The Jersey Blue is Willi Schmid's most decorated product: On two consecutive occasions, in 2010 and 2012, it won the "Best of Show" at the "World's Jersey Cheese Awards". The Jersey Blue undoubtedly proves the immense talent of its creator. Willi uses two different Italian molds. He doesn't reveal which ones, we only know Gorgonzola mold is not part of it. Natural calf rennet is used. The Jersey Blue is specially appealing cut when you see the fine light blue to dark green veins that grow into the core from the outside. The buttery feel of the Jersey milk coats the palate and then the powerful flavors of the mold burst out. It has an unbelievable long finish, a masterpiece indeed. The Jersey Blue can be enjoyed young but ages well. Of course, when it starts to dry out the flavors get sharper.
