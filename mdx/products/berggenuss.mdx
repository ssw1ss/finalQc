Franz Renggli is an innovative cheese maker in the UNESCO Biosphere in the Entlebuch valley. Operating in a certified mountain cheese zone he creates a lot of very smooth and creamy semihard cheeses. The “Berggenuss”, literally “enjoyment” or “treat” of the mountain, was one of the highlights we tasted during our visit in 2013. We actually tasted two different stages of aging, and even the early stage of ripening revealed mild but complex flavors. And it proved what Franz Renggli had explained: The quality of the pure mountain milk expresses itself in the product.
What really blew us away is the price: THIS IS A STEAL, PERIOD.
