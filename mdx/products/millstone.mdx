The Millstone ("Mühlistei" in Swiss, "Mühlestein" in German) is another example of the versatility of the Jersey cow milk, probably Willi's favorite ingredient. As small as the Jersey cows might be their milk contains the biggest fat globules, therefore the yellow color. As mentioned before, fat is the best flavor carrier, and the Millstone proves this again. It's a complex combination of milky flavors, cream with good acidity, and, of course, the moist smell of an aging cellar.

The natural gray mold in the aging caves of the "Städtlichäsi" give this cheese a funky look, but it is actually quite down to earth(y). With the Millstone Willi Schmid won the award of "Best Innovation" at the Swiss Cheese Awards.
