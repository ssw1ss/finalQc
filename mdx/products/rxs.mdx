Ueli Moser is one of the premier producers of Swiss soft cheeses. His innovative style has brought him many awards. The Riesling x Sylvaner was one of his first creations.

On the sunny slopes of the hilly region of the Canton Thurgau grow the grapes of the Mueller-Thurgau variety. The provide the crisp, dry Riesling x Sylvaner wine in which the little soft cheese is fortunate to take a bath overnight at the tender age of 8 to 10 days. Moser uses pasteurized cow milk to which he adds 2/3 of thermophile and 1/3 of mesophile cultures. On the surface he uses aerobic yeast cultures plus geotricum. The latter controls the growth of the yeast and keeps the surface dry. During the first 24 hours the cheeses are turned 3 to 4 times. After that they go to the aging room, kept at a humidity of between 85 and 95% and a temperature of between 58 and 60 degrees (lesser humidity and higher temperature in the beginning, higher humidity and lower temperature towards the end).
