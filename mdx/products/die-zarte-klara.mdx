Yes, the “Zarte Klara” is the girlfriend of “Der scharfe Maxx”. He fell in love with her during their maturation time in the cellar. Click here (needs link) to see Maxx’ love letter to Klara. He was heartbroxen and inconsolable when she left after 3 months.

Indeed, Klara is mild, subtle, rich due to the much shorter maturation compared to Maxx. She is beautifully light brown, just a lovely asset to every cheese plate. And, of course, a perfect partner for the much sturdier and spicier Maxx. Both together will satisfy all different kinds of cheese connoisseurs.
