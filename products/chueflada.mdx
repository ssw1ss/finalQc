The Chuefladä (or Cow's Pat) is another proof of the mastery of cheese maker Sepp Barmettler. It was the first co-production between him and Rolf Beeler, basically the central Swiss version of the Vacherin Mont d'Or, with the difference that the Chuefladae [Khooē-Flādə] is available all year since it is not made from winter milk only. This masterpiece is definitively a product for a cheese lover. Take a knife, cut open the lid (rind) and spoon the runny inside full of cream, fresh grass and barnyard on a piece of bread. Well, sometimes heaven is pretty close!
