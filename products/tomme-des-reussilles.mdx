This tomme was our first discovery on our trip to Switzerland in the summer 2013. No wonder, the dairy of Les Reussilles is only about 15 min. away from where Caroline's parents live. We spent about two hours with cheese makers Hansruedi Fuhrer und Willy Berger, and even before tasting the cheeses we knew we had come to a special place.

The Tomme des Reussilles is made of raw whole milk that is less than 12 hours old. It reminds you of a Reblochon, but the paste is quite dense, the reason being a light press of the cheese (about 4,5 lbs) which loses more water. The intense flavors also come the fact that the cheese is washed with the exactly same smear that the dairy uses for their gruy√®res. The soft custard-like core and the crunch of the rind make a great mix of texture. There is a hint of wood in the flavor, and Willy Berger knows why: "The cows graze on the beautiful Jura meadows surrounded by woods. And that flavor, that aroma is simply in the air, outside and in the aging cellars."
