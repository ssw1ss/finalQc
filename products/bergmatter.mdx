It is not unusual that cheeses are produced seasonal. The Bergmatter is one of these, made with the winter milk when cows are only fed hay, and with the aging, only available between July and February. "This milk is completely different, and I thought this would make for a great cheese", says Willi Schmid who they call the “cheese wizard”.

The Bergmatter has a funky appearance, with its uneven, bumpy rind reminding of a clothbound Vacherin Fribourgeois. The careful aging of at least 8 months reveals a cheese that is packed with - tender - flavors. And as climax in the end "the finish reminds of foie gras", raves Willi. What else is there to say?
