This is another classic Swiss cheese, known foremost for its important part in Fondues. Unfortunately very few cheese makers nowadays produce the Vacherin Fribourgeois the old way. At the top of the traditionalists is Marc-Henri Horner, cheese maker in Marsens near the city of Fribourg. Like all top cheese makers he has an immense passion, this becomes clear after you met him even for just a few minutes. And his approach is interesting, indeed: "I try to re-create the milk we had 50, 60 years ago", he explains while we stand in his old aging cellars where everything is done to provide the ideal environment. "The modern times with technology, pollution and so forth decrease the quality of the milk." In order to reach back into the last millenium Horner needs the support of the farmers: "I have to convince them that the easy way is not the best for quality." Once you taste his Vacherin you feel he has indeed made the trip back in time.
