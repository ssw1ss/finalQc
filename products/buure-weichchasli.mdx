The Buure-Weichchaesli [Boore-Waykh-khäslee] is generally made like the RieslingxSylvaner and the Chardonnay. The differences happen through the latter stages. 2/3 of thermophile and 1/3 of mesophile cultures are added to pasteurized cow milk. On the surfaces Moser uses aerobic yeast cultures plus geotricum. The latter controls the growth of the yeast and keeps the surface dry. Once in their forms the cheeses are turned 3 to 4 times within the first 24 hours.
After that, the little camembert buttons take a salt bath for about 20 minutes. In the aging room the "chaesli" cool down quickly due to their small size. This results in a high activity of the mesophile cultures working deeper down and thus letting the yeast cultures on the surface take center stage. That makes the buttons quite firm, but with a creamy core.
